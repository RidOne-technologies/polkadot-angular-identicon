# Polkadot Angular IdentIcon

A generic identity icon that can render icons in Angular applications for Substrate based chains

Project for the polkadot angular based identicons, serves also the web components.

## Usage Guide üçΩ 

We assume that you have the `angular cli` installed if not then inslall it by typing

`npm install -g @angular/cli`.

After the cli installation is done just type `ng --version` and it will display the Angular cli version
For more info please visit this [link](https://angular.io/cli).

## Create an Angular project

To create an angular project type: `ng new my-project` and the `my-project` will be created.

In our case let's create a project called `pai` (like polkadot-angular-identicon üòé)

`ng new pai` and you will see something like this

## install `polkadot-angular-identicon` npm dependency

Open the `pai` project via your favorite IDE and from IDE's terminal install the component
 `npm i polkadot-angular-dependency`.

After the package is installed open the `app.module.ts` file in the project under `src`  and add the `PolkadotIdentIconModule` into the `imports` section (this is the section were we import an angular module).

***The `PolkadotIdentIconModule` can be also used in any other  angular feature module in the `imports` or `exports` section***.

## Usage of the component

Now what we only have to do is to use the identicon in the template component of our linkings for instance in our `pai` project let's use it in the `app.component.html` file.

Open the `app.component.html`file and remove it's content and past this line:

```html

<h3>Polkadot icon theme  with default size</h3>
<polkadot-angular-identicon address="5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty" theme="polkadot"></polkadot-angular-identicon>
<br>

<h3>beachball icon theme  with size of 80 </h3>
<polkadot-angular-identicon address="5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty" theme="beachball" size="80"></polkadot-angular-identicon>
<br>

<h3>jdenticon icon theme  with size of 120</h3>
<polkadot-angular-identicon  address="5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty" theme="jdenticon" size="120"></polkadot-angular-identicon>
```

## final touches

At this step we are almost done but we need some final touches

open the `package.json` file and add at the following at the end before the closing bracket:

```json
"browser": {
    "crypto": false
}
```

open the `tsconfig.app.json` and add `"node"` to the `types` property in `compilerOptions` section

open `tsconfig.json` and add at the end of the `compilerOptions` add the following

```json
    "paths": {
      "crypto": ["./node_modules/crypto-browserify"],
      "stream": ["./node_modules/stream-browserify"]
      }
```

And one last thing open the `polyfills.ts` file under `src` and add the snippet below line at the end

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).Buffer = (window as any).Buffer || require('buffer').Buffer;
```

## Run the app
To test the app run the command `ng serve` and open your browser at `localhost:4200`

You can also type the command `ng serve -o` and it will automatically open the app in your default browser.

Improvements are on the way.
Happy coding üòé!!!
